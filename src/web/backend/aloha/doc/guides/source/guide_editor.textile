The Floating Menu will adjust it's position according to your text cursor. If you want to pin the Floating Menu in place, you can achieve this by using the pin icon in the upper right corner of the panel.

== Basic Formatting ==
After you clicked inside an Editable, a cursor will appear. Start typing and using keyboard controls to add / modify text.

By selecting a certain part of the text the Floating Menu will provide you with all possible formatting to be applied within the "Formatting" tab. You may also want to switch to the "Insert" tab, which allows you to insert new content elements. By clicking the respective buttons in the Floating Menu, a formatting can be applied and removed. If a formatting has already been applied to your text, the Floating Menu will display the corresponding buttons in pressed state, to reflect the markup.

The Floating Menu also provides you with a Word-like button which is used to apply different headings or paragraph styles. You can also expand this dialog by clicking the icon on it's right-hand side.

h3. Resize handles are shown around the table
If a user directly clicks on the table, resize handles are shown.

Due to an IE behaviour all block elements whithin an editable area will get resize handles on its boundaries. So for this surrounding element of the table. Its function is disabled by implementation but the display couldn't be suppressed.

h3. Cursor and Selection behaviour in IE8 with doctype 'html'
When using Aloha in IE8 and the doctype of the edited document is set to 'html' (HTML5), setting the cursor or selecting text does not work reliably.

A possible solution is to activate the Compatibility View.
